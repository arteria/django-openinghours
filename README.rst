   your own model.
-  Able to show if a company is currently open (“Come in, we’re open!”,
   “Sorry, we’re closed.”).
-  Able to list the opening hours, e.g. Monday 9am to 5pm, etc. for
   multiple company premises.
-  Possible to define opening hours passing midnight.
-  Possible to define closing hours, e.g. for holiday.

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'openinghours',
    )

You can use the company model provided or plug your own using

Quick dev preview setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repo and cd into it.

Then migrate into SQLite, load some test data and run the dev server like so.

::

    $ ./manage.py migrate
    $ ./manage.py shell
    >>> from openinghours.tests.tests import OpeningHoursTestCase as Data
    >>> Data.setUp(Data())
    $ ./manage.py runserver

Usage
-----

Set up a company
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app supports multiple companies (or your custom model) with
multiple opening and closing hours.

Set up opening hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Used to describe when premises are open, defined on a daily basis (per
day) by defining one or more start and end times of opening slots.

Optionally, set up the closing hour rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is used to define when premises are closed (e.g. due to a holiday,
absences, sickness or similar). Please note that the closing hours
override the opening hours.

You can find examples of how to use this app in our `templates`_.

Remarks
-------

Opening hours is built using datetime’s isoweekday. This means Monday is
represented by number 1 and Sunday by 7.

Planned features
----------------

Priority 1 = high/must have, 2 = and 3 = low/nice to have

- **1** Migrate to Django’s timezone
- **2** Docs for live testing of defined rules
- **3** Shortcut for everyday (1-7) = 0 in WEEKDAYS, or 8 = monday to
  friday, etc.
- **3** Global closing hours to override all companies. Use cases: close
  a whole shopping centre
